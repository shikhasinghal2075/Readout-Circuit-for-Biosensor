# Readout-Circuit-for-Biosensor
Arduino based readout circuit for biosensor.

# Overview
A biosensor is an analytical device (used for the detection of analyte) incorporating a biological sensing element either intimately connected to or
integrated within a transducer. It basically converts a biological response into an electrical signal.
-When the sample strip is applied to the Read-Out circuit or biosensor, it completes the circuit.
- As a result there is flow of current through the sample resistance and circuit.
-The op-amp or the trans-amplifier converts the current flowing into corresponding voltage signal at the output of amplifier.
-The output of amplifier is fed to the micro-controller through external 16-Bit ADC where the calculations are done and the value of sample resistance is calculated.
- Based on the calculated value of micro-controller, biosensor detects the level of ailment in the body by comparing it with some reference value and
displays on a LCD


# Our Project
The readout circuit is designed to read the value of the sample electrode, and display its value on LCD.
The read out circuit that has been used in our project is based on a CTNI test. The readout circuit has been designed to accurately predict the amount of troponin in the blood, by the means of conductivity of analyte.

## So That's how it all started!!!
 <ul>
  <li>CTNI TEST</li>
  <li>HOW IS IT CONDUCTED?</li>
  <li>HOW WE DESIGNED A CIRCUIT FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.</li>
  <li>Basically, It’s called – THE READOUT MACHINE……OR whatever fancy name you like!</li>
</ul> 

## Different Sections of the Project
 <ul>
  <li>THE SOFTWARE SECTION: Carrying out simulations on the circuit</li>
  <li>THE HARDWARE SECTION: Designing and working on the hardware section, taking readings, improving resolution</li>
  <li>THE DISPLAY SECTION: Development of an app which was bluetooth controlled</li>
</ul>
